    I started swimming üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and playing football ‚öΩÔ∏è at a young age. In ninth grade, I got the chance to attend a boarding school in England.\
    There, I gained my first abroad experience, as well as finished my GCSE's."},
    {"p":"Continuing my education, I went back home to Germany to complete the German High School degree (Abitur).\
    By then I had dropped football and purely focussed on swimming as my extra curicular activity. In 2015, I was able to qualify for the Junior National Team and \
    competed at the 1st European Games in Baku."},
    {"p": "After completion of the Abitur, I was fortunate to get the opportunity to move to Washington D.C. to continue \
    swimming and of course academia, where I studied Mechanical Engineering (B.Sc.) and was part of the Division I Swimming and Diving Team."},
    {"p":"After completing my Bachelor's Degree in 2020, I started my graduate studies at the Technical University of Munich. Alongside my studies, I work as a working student \
    at BMW, focusing on digitalizing of engineering research, development and production processes through the application of artificial intelligence.\
    Further, I am an active member of Germany's largest student organization centered around artifical intelligence, where I led and now mentor the software development of web \
    and cloud based applications."},
    {"p": "I am a very open-minded person and eager to learn and expand my knowledge about artifical intelligence, \
    data anlytics, AI in science, robotics and its applications."},
